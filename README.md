📊 Data Analytics Project
🔎 Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data analytics workflow — from raw data to actionable insights.

The project includes:

Loading and analyzing a dataset using Python

Performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Cleaning and preprocessing data

Running SQL queries in PostgreSQL / MySQL / SQL Server

Building an interactive Power BI dashboard

Creating a structured analytical report

Preparing a professional presentation using Gamma

The goal of this project is to showcase strong skills in data cleaning, analysis, SQL querying, and business intelligence reporting.

📁 Dataset

The dataset contains structured data relevant to business analysis (e.g., sales, customers, products, transactions, etc.).

Key characteristics:

Multiple columns (categorical & numerical)

Real-world data issues (missing values, duplicates, formatting inconsistencies)

Suitable for SQL querying and dashboard visualization

(You can replace this section with actual dataset description if needed.)
